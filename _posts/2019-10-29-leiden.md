I've been meaning for a while to develop an earnings-based trading plan, but I haven't had time to figure out a way to backtest it. I wish I had access to [institutional tools](http://solutions.refinitiv.com/qa-point-quantitative-investment-management/), but I don't, and backtesting in thinkorswim was thought out for different things. (I'm also beginning to think the TOS interface is considerably different on Mac vs Windows - and not in a good way.)

If I'll never get to actually backtest, at least I can get data points by trading live. This morning I see this e-mail from Market Chameleon and I decide to go ahead and sell butterflies on whichever of these are both overestimated and liquid enough. AR overestimated by almost 20%? Let's see how much it will move.

I managed to place trades on 8 of these; total max profit $3600, max loss $2100 (at expiration). I'm offloading them all tomorrow though.
