Good week-end in Worcester, with surprisingly high-quality appetizers at all events I attended (so -  a positive change from some previous gatherings).

It was great to see in person, and hear from, the state's upcoming new leadership. Some very charismatic new leaders, including an exciting candidate for State Auditor that I got to talk to for a little while:

Looking forward to the elections, and more importantly, to next year!
