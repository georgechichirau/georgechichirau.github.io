My main intellectual forebears are [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George) and [Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen); in other words, I am researching how to best integrate environmental sustainability, social justice and economic efficiency. I focus on public transit policy and urban housing development.

Within these areas, I have academic expertise on the following topics:

• Urban rail transit development. I began compiling the IDURC (International Database of Urban Rail Costs) to have data for my own research (*dataset currently offline*).

• Applying the [Rail + Property model](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-rail-plus-property-model) for funding urban transit (institutional investigations using systems thinking).

• Performing cost-benefit analyses for urban rail projects.  

My lifelong research agenda also includes:

• Creating a new public policy theoretical framework that is explicitly grounded in behavioral economics, ecological economics, institutional mapping and systems thinking.

• Bringing together urban planning, ecosystem modeling, and machine learning to automate connecting architectural form, ecological role and socioeconomic function.
